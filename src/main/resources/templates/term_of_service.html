    <br><br>
    <h3>Last Updated: 22th Jul, 2020</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>This End User License Agreement and Terms of Service (“EULA”) is between Hilarious Limited (“Hilarious”) and you, an individual user (“you”),
        and governs your use of Hilarious’s website at Hilarious.com (“Website”), mobile software application that has been made available for download (“App”)
        and any related websites or other online properties owned or controlled by Hilarious (together with the App, the “Service”).
        BY INSTALLING ANY APP OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS EULA.
        IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE.  </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>1.   GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
    <p>1.1           Description.
        <br>Hilarious is an online platform and social media website that allows users to upload and share user-generated content. It is a leading platform for entertainment content with millions of daily visitors. As used in this EULA,
        “User” means any user of the Service.</p>
    <p>1.2           Eligibility.
        <br>IN THE UNITED STATES, THE SERVICE IS NOT FOR PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 13.  FOR USERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, THE SERVICE IS NOT FOR PERSONS UNDER THE AGE FOR WHICH RULES APPLY ON A AGE-BASED BASIS FOR THE COLLECTION OF DATA (“RESTRICTED AGE”).  IN ALL CASES, THE SERVICE IS NOT FOR ANY USERS PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED OR REMOVED FROM THE SERVICE BY Hilarious.  IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE RESTRICTED AGE IN THE TERRITORY WHERE YOU RESIDE, THEN YOU MUST NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICE AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.  Furthermore, by using the Service, you affirm that either you are at least 18 years of age or have been authorized to use the Service by your parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years of age and entered into this EULA on your behalf.  If you are using the Service on behalf of an entity or organization, then you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity or organization to this EULA and you agree to be bound by this EULA on behalf of that entity or organization.</p>
    <p>1.3           Changes.
        <br>As the Service may undergo changes over time, we need the right to modify this EULA to match the changing functionalities of the Service.  You therefore agree that Hilarious may change this EULA at any time without prior notice other than posting an updated EULA to the Hilarious website or within our App. Hilarious will endeavor to provide you with prior notice when there are any material changes, and may require that you subsequently take an affirmative action acknowledging agreement to the revised EULA before continuing to access the Service.  You may read a current, effective copy of this EULA at any time at https://about.Hilarious.com/tos/ .  The revised EULA will become effective at the time of posting on the Service, and your use of the Service after such time will constitute your acceptance of the revised EULA.  If any change to this EULA is not acceptable to you, then your sole remedy is to stop using the Service.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this Section 1.3, no revisions to this EULA will apply to any dispute between you and Hilarious that arose prior to the effective date of those revisions.</p>
    <p>1.4           Consideration.
        <br>Hilarious currently provides you with access to the Service for free.  In return for enjoying this free access, you acknowledge and agree that Hilarious may generate revenues (including, by way of example and not limitation, through the sale of advertising and sponsorships, and the sublicensing of your User Content), increase goodwill or otherwise increase the value of Hilarious from your use of the Service, and you will have no right to share in any such revenues, goodwill or value whatsoever.  Hilarious in its sole discretion may eventually charge you fees to access certain features on the Service.  Hilarious will provide you with advance notice of any such changes before they take effect.  Even if we charge you a fee for the use of the Service, you will have no right to share in the revenues we charge you or other Users or to share in any goodwill or value created.  </p>
    <h3>2.    COMMUNITY GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>In addition to any other restrictions set forth in this EULA, and without limiting those restrictions, when using the Service, you agree not to (and not attempt to or assist any other person or entity in doing any of the following):  </p>

    <li>delete any copyright or other proprietary rights notices on any part of the Service;</li>
